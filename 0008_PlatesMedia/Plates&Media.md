**Making Plates & Media**

*Walker Orr, 04/03/2023*

**Purpose**

Preparing liquid media and agar plates for bacterial culturing.

**Required Equipment**

- Autoclave

**Required Reagents**

- LB Base (Miller)
- Agar (Bacto)

**Workflow**

Total time: ~2 hours

Active time: ~30 minutes

**Formula**

||**500 mL**|**1 L**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|2\.5% w/v LB Base (Miller)|12\.5 g|25 g|
|1\.5% w/v Agar (Bacto)|7\.5 g|15 g|
|DI Water|To 500 mL|To 1 L|

**Process**

1. Choose a flask whose capacity is at least twice the volume of the media you are making; this will prevent the Agar from boiling over.
1. Autoclave on liquid cycle (Cycle 03). This takes about an hour. When selecting the cycle make sure to press “Enter” and then “Okay.”
1. Wait to cool to 55°C or until touchable hot. While media is cooling, label the empty plates.
1. Add antibiotics, if using.
1. Pour ~20 mL for a standard round plate.

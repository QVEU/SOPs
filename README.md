# QVEU SOP Repo

This is a collection of SOPs in use in the QVEU. Some of them are copies or amalgamations of different kit protocols, but they also include "tips and tricks" that can assist new users by pointing out common pitfalls.  

Where computational tools are part of the protocol (for example, calculating the titer of a viral stock based on TCID50 scores), these will be included in a directory together with the paper protocol.  

Some protocols have multiple versions (for example, TCID50s can be done by hand, or they can be automated on the OpenTrons robot). These will also be collected in a directory together; different protocols will be given different sub-numbers to distinguish them.

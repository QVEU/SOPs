**Permeabilize, Fix, and Stain (for Intracellular Targets)**

|**Steps: Day One**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Put coverslips in a 24-well plate and let them dry under the hood for around 30 minutes. ||Cover slips are maintained in 100% ethanol. Sterilize the tweezers before use.|
|2. Plate cells on coverslips. For RD cells, this is usually around 125,000 cells; 20,000 for a 96-well plate.||In my experience, around 175,000 cells tends to work better.|
||||
|**Steps: Day Two**|||
|3. Wash cells with warm PBS.|||
|4. If infecting with virus, incubate for 1 hour (MOI 1) with 120 ul virus.|||
|5. After 1 hour, add 400 ul half-serum media.|||
|6. Incubate cells for 7 more hours.|||
|7. Wash with warm PBS.|||
|8. Fix with 4% PFA for 30 minutes.|||
|9. Wash with PBS.||You can leave the cells overnight at this step.|
|10. Add 400 ul of Permeabilization buffer. Let stand for **10 minutes.**||0\.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.|
|11. Wash with PBS.|||
|12. ` `Add 400 ul blocking buffer for **30 minutes**.||1% BSA in PBS.|
|13. ` `Incubate with primary antibody for **1 hour** (start with 1:1000 if you’re not sure).|||
|14. Wash three times with PBS.|||
|15. ` `Incubate with secondary antibody for **1 hour**||It might be a good idea to wrap the plate in tin foil to prevent photobleaching of the antibody.|
|16. Wash three times with PBS.|||
|17. Incubate with Draq5 (1:1000) or DAPI (4 drops/mL) for **30 minutes.**|||
|18. Wash twice with PBS.|||
|19. ` `Add one drop of prolong gold mounting media and mount the coverslip on a microscope slide.||Coverslips can be stored at 4C.|
|20. ` `Image with the EVOS microscope||In the hallway; Moss Lab.|
|21. ` `Prepare microscope slides with prolong gold mounting media, then transfer the coverslip to the slide.|||
|22. ` `Leave slides overnight at room temperature to cure. Then, store at 4C. Bring to room temperature again before imaging.|||

|**Steps: Day Two**|||
|3. Dilute antibodies in ice-cold HBSS.|||
|4. Aspirate media and wash cells twice with ice-cold HBSS.|||
|5. Incubate with primary antibody for 30 minutes, on ice.|||
|6. Wash twice with ice-cold HBSS.||You can leave the cells overnight at this step.|
|7. Incubate with secondary antibody for 30 minutes, on ice.|||
|8. Wash twice with ice-cold HBSS.|||
|9. Fix with 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 minutes.|||
|10. Wash three times with room-temperature HBSS.|||
|11. ` `Add DAPI (4 drops /mL in room-temperature HBSS) or Draq5 (1:1000).|||

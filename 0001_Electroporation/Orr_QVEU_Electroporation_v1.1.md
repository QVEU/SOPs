**General Comments**






**DNA Cleanup (A)**

This workflow starts by cleaning & concentrating the ligation reaction. Use “Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (5 ug).

|**Steps**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Dilute 1 part sample in **2 parts Binding Buffer**. Mix well by pipetting up and down; don’t vortex.||For a 20 µL ligation reaction, this means 40 µL binding buffer. Warm (N + 1) \* 8 µL water for elution **(50°C)**.|
|2. Insert column into collection tube and load sample. Spin at **16,000 x g** for **1 minute.** Discard flow-through.||Use **Eppendorf 5430.**|
|3. Reinsert column into collection tube. Add **200 µL** **DNA Wash Buffer** and spin at **16,000 x g** for **1 minute.**|||
|4. Repeat step 3.|||
|5. \*Discard flow-through and centrifuge dry at **16,000 x g** for **1 minute**.|||
|6. Transfer column to a clean, labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.||While transferring, don’t let the tip of the column touch the flow-through; if it does, re-centrifuge.|
|7. Add **8 µL** warmed nanopore water to the center of the filter. Let stand at **50C\*** for **3 minutes\***. Spin at **16,000 x g** for **1 minute** to elute DNA.||Touch the pipette tip to the filter when loading elution buffer.|



**Electroporation (B)**

Transform cleaned-up ligation reaction product into *E. coli*.

|**Steps**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Prewarm NEB® 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium (B9035S) in a water bath (**37°C**). Also prewarm selective plates at **37°C** for **1 hour**. Prepare round-bottom culture tubes.||Aliquot S.O.M… do not use directly from the stock container.|
|2. Prechill electroporation cuvettes **(1 mm)** and microcentrifuge tubes **on ice**.|||
|3. As a positive control for transformation, dilute control pUC19 by 1:5 for a final concentration of 10 pg/µL using sterile water. |||
|4. Thaw NEB 10-beta electrocompetent cells **on ice** (**about 10 minutes**) and mix cells by flicking gently. Transfer 25 µL of the cells to a chilled microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 µL of purified plasmid.|||
|5. Carefully transfer the cell/DNA mix to a chilled cuvette without introducing air bubbles. Make sure cells deposit across the bottom of the cuvette.||Use a 20 uL tip, because you need to be able reach through the narrow aperture at the bottom of the cuvette.|
|6. Electroporate using the following conditions: 2.0 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF. Time constant after shocking should be 4.8 – 5.1 ms.||Program WB on our electroporator.|
|7. Immediately add 975 µL **37°C** 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium to the cuvette, gently mix up and down twice, then transfer to round-bottom culture tube.|||
|8. Shake vigorously (**225 rpm**) at **37°C** for **1 hour**. |||



**Plating and Culturing (C)**

Plate cells to assess transformation efficiency and library coverage; grow cultures for Midiprep DNA harvesting.

|**Steps**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Dilute cells as appropriate and spread **100 µL** on warmed selective plates.||1:100; 1:10,000 by serial dilution are good places to start. For plating (-) control as well, you’ll want to do 2µL first culture:198 µL fresh LB so you have enough for both plates.|
|2. Transfer remaining first culture volume to **50 mL** **LB** (with selective antibiotics). Grow at **37°C** for **16 hours**.||Carb is 1:500, so **100 µL** per flask.|
|3. If you need to start a Midiprep later than 16 hours, transfer cultures to falcon tubes and **refrigerate**.|||

**Microneutralization Assay (IC50)**

*Walker Orr, 02/26/2024*

|**Steps**|
| :- |
|Day One|
|1. Plate as for a TCID50: 5,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate. You need approx. one plate per serum tested, plus an extra plate for back-titration of virus. |
|Day Two|
|1. Dilute virus to 2000 TCID50/ml in serum-free DMEM. You need 5 ml virus per plate.|
|2. Perform an initial dilution of antibody in serum-free DMEM if desired.|
|3. Dispense 100 ul antibody into the starting positions on your antibody dilution plate, and 50 ul serum-free DMEM everywhere else on the plate. |
|4. Perform two-fold serial dilutions of antibody. Change tips after every dilution. Remove the 50 ul diluted antibody that remains in the final position of the plate.|
|5. Dispense 50 ul virus to each well on the antibody dilution plate.|
|6. Incubate for 1-2 hours at 37C. |
|7. Transfer to cells, starting with the most dilute sample.|
|8. Incubate 3-5 days at 37C, then score as a TCID50.|

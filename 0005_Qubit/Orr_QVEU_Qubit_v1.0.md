**Qubit**

*Walker Orr, 03/23/2023*

**Required Equipment**

- Qubit

**Required Supplies**

- Qubit tubes

**Required Reagents**

- Qubit buffer and loading dye
- Qubit standards (at **4°C**)
- DNA samples to be quantified

**Workflow**

~15 minutes

**General Comments**

For plasmid DNA, you will generally use the BR (“broad range”) kit which goes from 1-1000 ng DNA. If your sample is <1000 ng/µL, use 1 µL sample in 199 µL loading buffer.

|**Steps**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Setup the Qubit for your desired number of samples, plus two standards and allowance for overage. The machine will calculate the amount of buffer and dye you need to mix. Mix this to make loading buffer.|||
|2. Make sure your DNA samples are well mixed. Pipette up and down or vortex and spin.|||
|3. For each standard: add **190 µL** loading buffer and 10 µL standard to a Qubit tube.|||
|4. For each sample: add **199 µL** loading buffer and **1 µL** DNA sample to a Qubit tube. In general, add an amount of DNA whose estimated concentration falls within the range stipulated by the standard kit being used and adjust buffer as needed to reach **200 µL**.|||
|5. Mix standards and samples. For plasmid DNA, vortexing is OK. Let stand **2 minutes** to stabilize before measuring.|||
|6. Measure standards and samples on the Qubit.|||

**Receiving DNA**

*Walker Orr, 04/03/2023*

**Purpose**

Preparing lyophilized DNA (primers and other oligos) for use in downstream applications.

**Required Equipment**

- Centrifuge

**Required Reagents**

- Buffer (Low TE or water, depending)

**For Primers (IDT):**

1. Start by spinning the dry DNA down in a benchtop centrifuge. 
1. To make 100 µM stocks of primers, use “Low TE” (Invitrogen, 12090-015). The primer label will provide the total DNA mass in the tube; it will be ~25 nmol. To obtain a concentration of 100 µM, add a volume of low TE (in µL) equal to the mass in nanomoles times 10; so for 25 nmol you’ll add 250 µL.
1. Vortex briefly. Spin down.
1. To make 10 µM working stocks of primers, dilute 100 µM stock ten-fold in PCR-grade water. Vortex briefly and spin down.

**For Oligos (Twist)**

1. Follow the same procedure as above but resuspend in water instead of TE. There is no difference between the stock and working stock. For SPINE/DIMPLE inserts, aim for a final concentration of 20 ng/uL. 
1. Place the oligo stocks in the “Twist” box (for William), assign consecutive numbers, and update the spreadsheet.

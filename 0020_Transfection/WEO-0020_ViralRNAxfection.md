**Transfection of Viral RNA**

## **Transfection of RD cells with viral RNA**

|<p>1. Plate cells and incubate overnight. Cells should be around 80% confluent prior to transfection.</p><p>&emsp;a. 2 million cells in a T25 flask is a good starting point.</p>|
| :- |
|<p>2. Prepare reagents:</p><p>&emsp;a. Room temperature OptiMEM.</p><p>&emsp;b. Room temperature TransIT mRNA and mRNA Boost reagent (Mirus, stored at 4C). Vortex gently and spin down before use!</p><p>&emsp;c. 37C DPBS</p><p>&emsp;d. 37C Serum-free DMEM</p><p>&emsp;e. 37C Standard DMEM (10% FBS and Pen/Strep)</p><p>&emsp;f. Thawed RNA, kept on ice.</p>|
|3. In the cell culture hood, prepare 5 mL 5% FBS DMEM per flask.|
|4. Change the media in each flask to 5% FBS DMEM. First, wash with DPBS, then add the low FBS DMEM. Return cells to 37C while you prepare the mRNA.|
|<p>5. Prepare TransIT-mRNA Reagent:mRNA Boost:RNA complexes (immediately before transfection!) as follows (for each flask individually):</p><p>&emsp;a. 630 ul OptiMEM</p><p>&emsp;b. 3.25 ug mRNA</p><p>&emsp;c. 6.5 ul mRNA Boost</p><p>&emsp;d. 6.5 ul Trans-IT</p><p>Note that the amounts of RNA, Boost and TransIT are half the amounts recommended by Mirus; we have found that these lower amounts give better viral yields.</p><p>After adding each reagent to the tube, pipette up and down with a P1000.</p><p>Let stand for 2-5 minutes (3 minutes is good). Then, add dropwise to the corresponding flask.</p>|
|6. Return flasks to 37C and let stand for 2 days before recovering virus.|

**TapeStation: D1000 ScreenTape Assay**

*Walker Orr, 03/27/2023*

**Application**

Detect up to 5 pg/µL 35bp-1kb DNA.

**Required Equipment**

Agilent TapeStation

**Required Supplies**

Tape cartridge with enough remaining wells

**Required Reagents**

Loading buffer (2 µL/sample)

Ladder (2µL)

**Sample Workflow**

|**Steps**||
| :- | :- |
|1. Bring buffer and ladder to room temperature for **at least 30 minutes**. Briefly vortex and spin down.||
|2. Launch the Agilent TapeStation Controller software.||
|3. Load a High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape into the TapeStation machine.||
|4. Prepare appropriate dilutions of your sample. For PCRs, dilute 1 µL sample in 9 µL water. This is to minimize leftover PCR buffer, which can interfere with the TapeStation. Label your tube so you know where the ladder is; it is always read from well A1 in the TapeStation.||
|5. Prepare diluted samples for the TapeStation by combining **2 µL** sample with **2 µL** loading buffer (![](Aspose.Words.bba5f6e6-6c21-48b0-9923-b6c2a3d400f6.001.png)) in PCR strip tubes. The ladder (![](Aspose.Words.bba5f6e6-6c21-48b0-9923-b6c2a3d400f6.002.png)) will be prepared the same way.||
|6. Vortex samples using the TapeStation vortexer: 2000 rpm for **1 minute.** Then, spin down.||
|7. Cut lids off from strip tubes.||

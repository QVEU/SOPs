**General Comments**

- 4 is a good number for the first few times; later can do up to ~8 preps at a time.



|**Steps**||**Helpful Hints**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1. Transfer your culture to falcon tubes. Harvest at **4,150 x g\*** for **15** **minutes** at **4** **°C**.||Use the **Allegra X14-R;** 4150 x g** is max speed.|
|2. Drain supernatant. Resuspend pellet in **4 mL Buffer P1.** Transfer resuspended pellet to lidded reusable Nalgene autoclave tubes.||Invert tubes over Kimwipe for more complete supernatant removal. Use serological pipette to resuspend the pellet; tip can be used to physically break up the pellet. Air bubbles okay here.|
|3. Add **4 mL** **Buffer P2** and mix by vigorously inverting 6-8 times. Incubate at **room temperature** for **5 minutes**. If using LyseBlue, the solution will turn blue.|||
|4. Add **4 mL** **Buffer P3** (4C) and mix by inverting 4-6 times. If using LyseBlue, the solution will turn white. Incubate **on ice** for **15 minutes**.|||
|5. Centrifuge at **20,000 x g** for **45 minutes\*** at **4 °C.**||Use the **Thermo-Fisher RC6+.** To tighten rotor nut, completely turn bottom knob, then top knob. Loosen in reverse.|
|6. Prepare a QIAGEN-100 tip by washing it with **4 mL Buffer QBT**, and allow column to drain by gravity flow.|||
|7. Transfer supernatant yielded from step 5 to the column and let drain fully.||This takes around 15 minutes.|
|8. Wash QIAGEN-tip with **10 mL** **Buffer QC.** Repeat, for a total of 2 washes.||This takes 15-20 minutes total.|
|9. Elute DNA in 5 mL **Buffer QF**.||Capture the eluent in a clean 50-mL falcon tube.|
|10. Precipitate DNA by adding **3.5mL room temperature isopropanol.** Centrifuge for **30 minutes\*** at **max rcf** and **4 °C**.||Use **Eppendorf 5430R** at **max rcf.** Chill with “fast temp.” Load tubes in same orientation. To drain, use the electric vacuum aspirator. Don’t aspirate pellet!|
|11. Wash pellet with **2 mL fresh 70% ethanol** and centrifuge at **max rcf** and **4 °C** for **10 minutes.** Carefully decant supernatant.||Aspirate the ethanol. You need to be more thorough than in Step 10. If doing 8 preps, leave half in Step 10.|
|12. Air-dry pellet for **30 minutes\***. Redissolve in a suitable volume of appropriate buffer.||Buffer is **nanopure water; 200 uL**. Redissolve first pellet and carry across to all four tubes to capture all of the DNA.|
|13. Assess DNA concentration and purity by nanodrop. ||Use **2 uL**.|

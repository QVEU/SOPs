**Workflow Overview:**

1. Go on the Plasmidsaurus website and submit your samples. There’s an excel sheet on the team drive called “Plasmidsaurus Rollup” that details how to do this. Credentials for Plasmidsaurus are:

username: Patrick.Dolan@nih.gov

password: QVEU\_\_1e19 *(two underscores)*

1. Email our purchasing agent (email text in the excel sheet) and update the sheet with your order cost and number.
1. Use Qubit protocol **(SOP WO #0005)** to obtain an accurate measure of the sample’s concentration.
1. In PCR strip tubes, labeled as directed by Plasmidsaurus, prepare dilutions of your samples to **30 ng/µL** in **20 µL** and mix. Wrap the strip tube in parafilm. Place the wrapped strip inside a labeled falcon tube stuffed with Kimwipes.
1. Get a Fedex bubble mailer and pouch from Xiomara in the LVD office and package your samples.
1. Go on the Fedex website and login with our lab credentials. As of the last update of this document, that’s: 

username: niaidlvdofficesupport
password: Vaccinia0

1. Take the sample to the Fedex dropbox outside of Building 6.
